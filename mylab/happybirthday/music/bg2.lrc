[00:03.86]背景音乐是《She》
[00:05.86]本想写个贺卡
[00:08.86]无奈字写得太丑了 T T
[00:11.86]于是干脆做个小玩意儿来代替
[00:14.86]生日快乐哦~ ^ ^
[00:18.86]She hangs out every day near by the beach
[00:23.64]Havin’ a harnican fallin’ asleep
[00:28.31]She looks so sexy when she’s walking the sand
[00:33.06]Nobody ever put a ring on her hand
[00:37.83]Swim to the oceanshore fish in the sea
[00:42.59]She is the story the story is she
[00:47.09]She sings to the moon and the stars in the sky
[00:51.80]Shining from high above you shouldn’t ask why
[00:56.48]She is the one that you never forget
[01:01.07]She is the heaven-sent angel you met
[01:05.63]Oh, she must be the reason why God made a girl
[01:10.52]She is so pretty all over the world
[01:15.30]She puts the rhythm, the beat in the drum
[01:19.91]She comes in the morning and the evening she’s gone
[01:24.52]Every little hour every second you live
[01:29.53]Trust in eternity that’s what she gives
[01:34.25]She looks like Marilyn, walks like Suzanne
[01:38.87]She talks like Monica and Marianne
[01:43.49]She wins in everything that she might do
[01:48.32]And she will respect you forever just you
[01:53.12]She is the one that you never forget
[01:57.42]She is the heaven-sent angel you met
[02:02.01]Oh, she must be the reason why God made a girl
[02:07.16]She is so pretty all over the world
[02:11.98]She is so pretty all over the world
[02:19.67]She is so pretty
[02:24.45]She is like you and me
[02:28.11]Like them like we
[02:31.25]She is in you and me
[02:35.68]She is the one that you never forget
[02:40.19]She is the heaven-sent angel you met
[02:44.57]Oh, she must be the reason why God made a girl
[02:49.57]She is so pretty all over the world
[02:54.37](She is the one) She is the one
[02:57.25](That you never forget) That you never forget
[02:58.87]She is the heaven-sent angel you met
[03:03.67]She’s the reason (oh she must be the reason) why God made a girl
[03:08.19]She is so pretty all over the world (oh...)
